* Project Red added. Adds a bunch of advanced redstone objects and fancy lights. Ores are present via chickens only.
* Random Patches added. Fixes a whole swath of minor minecraft bugs, also tweaks some data and speed limits internally to hopefully improve server stability for some users and to reduce rubber-banding in flight and the metro.
* Refined Storage added. Powerful new ways to store items and access the items stored across your base!
* SignEdit added. Signs can now be edited by right clicking them with a sign. (You're welcome Murphy).
* Storage Cabinet added. Adds the storage cabinet, a container that can contain a huge number of a single type of item which are unstackable and identical except for extra data (e.g. different copies of the same tool/weapon, or different enchanted books).
* Thermal Dynamics added. Adds ducts for moving items, fluids and other things. Smeltery casting recipes available where liquid transposer would have been required.
* Vanilla Plus Satchels added. Craft satchels to help you carry stuff around!
* Veinminer added. Allows vein mining of wood, ore and other things.
* Laser guns enabled for plusTIC.
* Constantan, Lumium and Enderium are now all useable as tinkers materials.
* Redstone ore can now be melted in the smeltery for a minor yield boost.
* Redstone, glowstone, ender pearls can all be re-cast as both dust and blocks where available in the smeltery.
* Aerotheum, Cryotheum, Petrotheum and Pyrotheum can all be melted and recast from their dust form in the smeltery.
* The melter should now run hotter allowing a few different items to be smelted in it, including making seared stone.
* Thaumic Crystal chicken added, produces thaumic crystals which can be combined with primal aspect crystals to make more.
* Ruby, Sapphire, Peridot and Electrotine chickens added to support projectred use.

### Changes
* Coal, Quartz, Diamond, Emerald, Amber and Quicksilver chickens now produce items rather than ores.
* Vanilla food now restores original hunger values, allowing players to avoid harvestcraft if they want.
* Lava eggs can now be used as furnace fuel. Both lava and water eggs can be crafted with an empty bucket to create a lava/water bucket and can both be melted in a smeltery into liquid lava/water.
* Botania chickens have been rebalanced to better reflect their positions in the tech tree. Elementium chickens are now less expensive, Terrasteel chickens are now more expensive to better represent their position as an end game item.
